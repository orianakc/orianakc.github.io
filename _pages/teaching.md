Courses I have designed and taught include phonetics, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, cognitive science of language, morphology, and introductory linguistics. I have also led course sections as a teaching assistant in courses on formal semantics and phonological theory. 
My teaching methodology is centered around inclusive and anti-racist practices. I'm also an associate of the [Center for Integration of Teaching and Learning](https://www.cirtl.net/), an organization that promotes evidence-based practices to support diverse learners in higher education.
