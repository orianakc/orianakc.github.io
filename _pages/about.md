Nice to meet you. 

I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Linguistics at Northwestern University, working with Matt Goldrick at <a href="http://groups.linguistics.northwestern.edu/soundlab/v2/" title="">SoundLab</a>. I completed my PhD at McGill University and have taught at Concordia University, both in charming Montr√©al, QC. 

My research tackles topics in phonology, phonetics, and speech production. I use the methodologies of acoustic corpus analysis and speech production experiments to investigate _how_ speakers plan what they're about to say, and how that planning affects the _pronunciation_ of what they end up saying. Do you think you might pronounce words differently if you also had to remember a phone number while talking, or if you had to read a sentence full of words that you know but don't use very often? These are a few of the questions I'm trying to answer in my research. 

To learn more, take a look at my projects page, list of publications, and past course descriptions. You can also send me an [email](mailto:oriana.kilbourn-ceron@northwestern.edu), [tweet](https://twitter.com/OrianaKilbourn) at me, or request any of my articles though [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Oriana_Kilbourn-Ceron/). You can find any available data and scripts through my [OSF profile](https://osf.io/d6s7w/).
